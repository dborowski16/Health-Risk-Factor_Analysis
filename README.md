# Health Risk Factor Analysis

![Demo](https://github.com/dborowski16/d3-challenge/blob/main/d3_data_journalism/assets/demo.gif)

# Introduction:
The goal of this particaular assignment as someone starting out working for a newspaper tasked with working on data visualization, was to take in health data along with some demographics to asses the risk factors to ones health.  The data set provided is census data from the following link.  https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml
The end product was to build a interactive chart that would allow the user to select multiple x and y axes to plot the metrics for analysis to asses which factor and groups of people would be more at risk when it comes to categories such as income, age, obesity, smoking, and lack of insurance.

# Tools:
In order the produce the interactive chart, the following tools were used:
- JavaScript
- The D3 package in JS
- HTML to build the front end for visualization
- Bootstrap and CSS

# End Users:
The code can be adapted to take an any standard .csv file with multiple columns using the D3 package and and plotted as a scatter plot.  Once the data is brought in, the user would be allowed to vary the x and y axes to make visualization easy for anyone with interest in the analysis.

# Conclusions from this data
The initial observations of the health data given for investigations into health risks does lead to some conclusions in terms of those who art most risk.

A first glance at the data pertaining to poverty shows that as poverty level goes up, so does the overall lack of health insurance. One can also point out that the obesity rate and percentage of smokers goes up as well for those in povery, leading to greater health risk.  These correllations also hold true when comparing the same metrics to household income, as expected.

Another observation to point out would be that younger people tend to not have health care, potentially being at risk. There doesn't seem to be a strong correlation to age as it pertains to smoking or obesity, however.
