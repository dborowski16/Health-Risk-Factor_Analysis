          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <P></P>
          <h4>Click on any of the axes to switcht the data sets for a comparisson of variables</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>The initial observations of the health data given for investigations into health risks does lead to some conclusions
            in terms of those who art most risk.</p>

          <p>A first glance at the data pertaining to poverty shows that as poverty level goes up, so does the overall lack of health insurance.
            One can also point out that the obesity rate and percentage of smokers goes up as well for those in povery, leading to 
            greater health risk.  These correllations also hold true when comparing the same metrics to household income, as expected.</p>

          <p>Another observation to point out would be that younger people tend to not have health care, potentially being at risk. There doesn't
            seem to be a strong correlation to age as it pertains to smoking or obesity, however.
